            <h2>1. Fiction: from The Giver by Lois Lowry</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">Jonas had never seen a private collection of books before. The only books in the community were the dictionary, the community map, and the Book of Rules. But here, in the Annex room, shelves lined every wall, filled to the ceiling. An old man, his eyes weary but kind, watched him from a chair. "You are the new Receiver of Memory," he said, his voice calm. Jonas, filled with a nervous apprehension, could only nod.

"I am the Giver," the old man clarified. "It is my job to transmit to you all the memories of the past, the memories of the whole world." He gestured for Jonas to lie face-down on the padded table. "This will not hurt," he promised.

Jonas obeyed, feeling the man's cool hands on his bare back. Suddenly, a new sensation enveloped him. It began with a perception of cold. He was no longer in the warm room but outdoors, sitting on something hard and flat. He was on a sled, perched at the top of a steep hill. With a gentle push, the sled began to move, gliding silently downhill. The wind, a concept he had never truly known, whistled past his ears. Beneath him, he could feel the smooth runners of the sled on a soft, packed substance: snow. He had never felt snow, or cold, or wind. It was a cascade of new feelings, both strange and wonderful.

The sled accelerated, and a feeling of pure, unadulterated joy surged through him. It was exhilarating. His own world, the community, was flat and climate-controlled. There were no hills, no snow, no unpredictable weather. There was only the meticulously managed Sameness. As the memory faded and he found himself back in the quiet room, he struggled to find words for the experience.

"How do you feel?" the Giver asked gently.

"I feel... happy," Jonas managed, the word feeling inadequate.

"It was 'joy'," the Giver corrected softly. "And what you felt was snow." He paused, his gaze distant. "I have thousands of memories like that one. And many that are not so pleasant. I have the memory of pain, and war, and hunger, and loneliness. It is my job to hold them. Now, it is your job to receive them."</div>

            <h2>2. Fiction: from The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The sky was getting dark, and we were at the top of Jay Mountain. I was still shivering with cold and shock. Johnny sat leaning against a tree, his legs drawn up. He was pale, and his dark eyes were enormous. "Ponyboy," he said quietly.

"Yeah?" I was still staring at the valley below us.

"We're in a lot of trouble, ain't we?"

"Yeah," I said, my voice trembling. I could still see the Soc, Bob, lying there in the moonlight, his face white and still. I could see the blood on my hands. "We gotta get out of here. Get somewhere."

Johnny didn’t say anything. I looked at him. He was watching the stars. "That was a tough break," I said. "You couldn't help it."

"I know," he said. He was still watching the stars. "You know, I never noticed colors and clouds and stuff until you started reminding me about them. It's like they were never there before." He was quiet for a minute. "It's like that poem you read to me. The one about the golden hour."

I knew what he meant. The poem was by Robert Frost. "Nature's first green is gold, / Her hardest hue to hold. / Her early leaf's a flower; / But only so an hour."

Johnny’s eyes were closed. "Stay gold, Ponyboy," he whispered. "Stay gold." The ground was getting damp, and I wondered if he was cold. His breathing was shallow.

I remembered him in the fire, saving those kids. I remembered him standing up to Dally at the drive-in. He wasn’t a hero because he killed Bob. He was a hero because he was Johnny. And he was my best friend.

He was silent for a long time, and I thought he was asleep. But then he spoke again, so softly I could barely hear him. "It's a shame... you can't see the stars from the city. They're too bright."

I didn’t know what to say. I just sat there, beside him, watching the sky. The world felt big and empty. And I was scared.</div>

            <h2>3. Fiction: from Holes by Louis Sachar</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">Stanley felt the shovel strike something hard. He paused, his heart pounding. He had been at Camp Green Lake for what felt like an eternity, digging his hole five feet deep and five feet wide every single day under the brutal Texas sun. The Warden said it was to build character, but Stanley knew they were looking for something. He had never found anything but dirt and rocks. Until now.

He dug around the object, then gently lifted it out of the hole. It was a small, golden tube, about the size of his finger. It was open at one end and closed at the other. He carefully wiped the dirt off on his pants. On the flat, closed end, there was an engraving: the letters KB, intertwined inside a heart. He had no idea what it meant. But he knew it was important. He knew, somehow, that this was what the Warden was looking for.

A nervous energy coursed through him. What should he do? If he gave it to the Warden, she had promised the rest of the day off to anyone who found something interesting. He could get a double shower and relax in the Wreck Room. But what if she took it and claimed she found it herself? Or worse, what if this KB was something bad?

He thought of X-Ray, the leader of his group of boys in Tent D. X-Ray had been there the longest and had the most influence. He had told Stanley that if he ever found anything, he should give it to him. X-Ray said it was because he deserved a day off more than a newcomer like Stanley. He argued it would build camaraderie, make Stanley look good in the long run.

Stanley clutched the tube in his hand. It felt cool and smooth against his sweaty palm. He glanced over at the other boys, their orange jumpsuits dotting the barren landscape, each one a prisoner in his own five-foot-deep world. For the first time, he felt like he had a choice that mattered. This little tube held power, and he wasn't sure who to give it to, or if he should give it to anyone at all.</div>

            <h2>4. Fiction: from Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The next few days I settled into a routine that felt almost normal, if you don't count the fact that I was getting sword-fighting lessons from a centaur and my best friend was a satyr. I would wake up in the Hermes cabin, a place crammed with bunk beds and overflowing with the unclaimed children of the god of travelers, messengers, and thieves. My bunkmate, Luke, son of Hermes, would usually be practicing with his sword, a wicked-looking blade named Backbiter that was half celestial bronze, half tempered steel.

After a breakfast of strawberries and ambrosia—which tasted like my mom's homemade blue chocolate-chip cookies—I'd head to the archery range, where I was hopelessly bad, or to the canoe lake, where I felt more at home. But the highlight of my day was sword practice. Mr. D (Dionysus, the camp director, who was being punished by Zeus and hated every minute of it) would watch us with bored disdain, while Chiron, the centaur activities director, would patiently guide me.

"Your father's power is in you, Percy," Chiron would say. "The sea does not like to be restrained." I didn't know what he meant. I still didn't know who my father was. All I knew was that some monster, the Minotaur, had attacked me, and my mother had vanished in a flash of gold dust. Now I was here, at Camp Half-Blood, a place for demigods.

One afternoon, Clarisse, a brutish daughter of Ares, the god of war, decided to give me her traditional welcome. She and her cronies dragged me toward the camp bathrooms. "Time for a swirlie, Prissy," she sneered. I struggled, but they were too strong. They shoved my head toward the toilet bowl. I remember feeling a strange tug in the pit of my stomach. The water in the pipes rumbled. Then, with a roar, every toilet and shower in the building exploded, blasting streams of water straight at Clarisse and her gang, knocking them off their feet. The water didn't touch me. I stood in the only dry spot in the entire room, completely untouched. Everyone stared at me, their mouths agape. And for the first time, I felt a surge of power, a connection to something ancient and vast. The sea, Chiron had said. I was starting to understand.</div>

<b>MAMA:</b> They spirited all right, my children. Got to admit they got spirit. Like this old plant that ain't never had enough sunshine or nothing—and look at it...

<b>JULIET:</b> O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

<b>ROMEO:</b> (Aside) Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

<b>JULIET:</b> 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

<b>ROMEO:</b> (To JULIET) I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

<b>JULIET:</b> What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

<b>ROMEO:</b> By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

<b>JULIET:</b> My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

(It is late afternoon. The curtains are drawn. The room is still and dark. From outside, the sound of a barrel organ can be heard. ANNE is curled up on the sofa, reading. MARGOT is sitting at the table, studying. Suddenly, PETER enters from his room. He is holding a cat, a scrawny, black creature.)

<b>PETER:</b> I've brought him. His name's Mouschi.

<b>ANNE:</b> (Jumping up) A cat! Oh, Peter, a cat! I love cats. He's beautiful. What a beautiful, beautiful cat. (She reaches out to pet him, but PETER pulls back.)

<b>PETER:</b> He's very shy. He's not used to people.

<b>MRS. VAN DAAN:</b> (From the kitchen) Peter, what have you got there?

<b>PETER:</b> A cat.

<b>MRS. VAN DAAN:</b> (Entering) A cat! In here? We'll all be eaten alive by fleas! Take it out of here this minute!

<b>PETER:</b> But Mother...

<b>MR. FRANK:</b> (Entering, calmly) Mrs. Van Daan, it's just a cat. Peter, perhaps you should keep him in your room.

<b>MR. VAN DAAN:</b> (Following his wife) It's not just a cat. It's another mouth to feed. We don't have enough for ourselves, and you bring a cat? Do you know what they're paying for a sack of potatoes on the black market? And you bring a cat.

<b>ANNE:</b> He can have my food. I'll give him all my food.

<b>MR. DUSSEL:</b> (From his corner, without looking up from his book) I am a man who has always been allergic to cats. They make me sneeze. My throat closes up. I could die.

<b>PETER:</b> (To his cat) Don't worry, Mouschi. I'll take care of you.

(He takes the cat and disappears into his room. ANNE looks after him, her face a mixture of disappointment and sympathy. MR. FRANK shakes his head slightly, a sad smile on his face.)

<b>MR. FRANK:</b> We are all a little on edge. It's been a long time. We must remember to be patient with one another. We are all here for the same reason. To survive.</div>

            <h2>8. Poetry: "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-1"><p class="question-text">1. The "two roads diverged" is a metaphor for:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-1-options" value="A"> A. a difficult journey through a forest.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-1-options" value="B"> B. a choice between two paths in life.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-1-options" value="C"> C. the speaker's love for nature.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-1-options" value="D"> D. an argument between two people.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-2"><p class="question-text">2. In the second stanza, the speaker notes that the second road "wanted wear." This phrase means the road:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-2-options" value="A"> A. was old and worn out.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-2-options" value="B"> B. was an undesirable or bad path.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-2-options" value="C"> C. seemed to lack travelers; it was not worn down.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-2-options" value="D"> D. was in need of repair.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-3"><p class="question-text">3. How does the speaker almost immediately contradict his reason for taking the second road?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-3-options" value="A"> A. By saying he will come back to the first road later.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-3-options" value="B"> B. By admitting that the passing there had worn them "really about the same."</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-3-options" value="C"> C. By describing the wood as "yellow."</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-3-options" value="D"> D. By expressing regret for his choice.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-4"><p class="question-text">4. The "sigh" in the final stanza is best interpreted as a sign of:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-4-options" value="A"> A. simple happiness and contentment.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-4-options" value="B"> B. clear regret for making the wrong choice.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-4-options" value="C"> C. physical exhaustion from the long journey.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-4-options" value="D"> D. complex reflection, blending satisfaction, nostalgia, and perhaps a touch of melancholy.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-5"><p class="question-text">5. What does the line "Yet knowing how way leads on to way, / I doubted if I should ever come back" reveal about the nature of life's choices?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-5-options" value="A"> A. That it is easy to reverse decisions we have made.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-5-options" value="B"> B. That one choice often leads to another, making it difficult or impossible to return to the original point.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-5-options" value="C"> C. That all paths eventually lead to the same destination.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-5-options" value="D"> D. That the speaker is a poor navigator and is lost.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-6"><p class="question-text">6. The final two lines—"I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference"—suggest that:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-6-options" value="A"> A. the speaker made the correct and best choice.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-6-options" value="B"> B. the speaker made a terrible mistake.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-6-options" value="C"> C. the choice of the less-traveled path has had a profound impact on his life, for better or worse.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-6-options" value="D"> D. the speaker believes his life would be the same no matter which path he took.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-7"><p class="question-text">7. The overall mood of the poem is best described as:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-7-options" value="A"> A. triumphant and celebratory.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-7-options" value="B"> B. pensive and reflective.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-7-options" value="C"> C. sorrowful and regretful.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-7-options" value="D"> D. frightened and anxious.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-8"><p class="question-text">8. The word <b>diverged</b> in the first line means:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-8-options" value="A"> A. joined together.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-8-options" value="B"> B. ended abruptly.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-8-options" value="C"> C. branched off or split.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-8-options" value="D"> D. became difficult.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-9"><p class="question-text">9. By stating the roads were worn "really about the same," the poet implies that:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-9-options" value="A"> A. the speaker's future claim of taking the "less traveled" path is more about creating a meaningful story than a literal fact.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-9-options" value="B"> B. the speaker has poor eyesight and cannot see the paths clearly.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-9-options" value="C"> C. there was no real choice to be made between the two paths.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-9-options" value="D"> D. many people had traveled both roads that day.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-8-10"><p class="question-text">10. What is the central theme of the poem?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-10-options" value="A"> A. The beauty of autumn.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-10-options" value="B"> B. The importance of following the crowd.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-10-options" value="C"> C. The way we reflect upon and give meaning to our choices long after we make them.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-8-10-options" value="D"> D. The regret that comes from making any decision.</label></div></div>

Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.
It's had tacks in it,
And splinters,
And boards torn up,
And places with no carpet on the floor—
Bare.
But all the time
I'se been a-climbin' on,
And reachin' landin's,
And turnin' corners,
And sometimes goin' in the dark
Where there ain't been no light.
So boy, don't you turn back.
Don't you set down on the steps
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.
Don't you fall now—
For I'se still goin', honey,

            <h2>10. Poetry: from "Still I Rise" by Maya Angelou</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

Did you want to see me broken?
Bowed head and lowered eyes?
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,
Weakened by my soulful cries?

Does my haughtiness offend you?
Don't you take it awful hard
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
Diggin’ in my own backyard.

You may shoot me with your words,
You may cut me with your eyes,
You may kill me with your hatefulness,
But still, like air, I’ll rise.

Does my sexiness upset you?
Does it come as a surprise
That I dance like I've got diamonds
At the meeting of my thighs?

Out of the huts of history’s shame
I rise
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.</div>
