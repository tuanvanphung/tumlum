            <h2>1. The Starry Messenger by Galileo Galilei</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">Great indeed are the things which in this brief treatise I propose for observation and consideration by all students of nature. I propose them, I say, knowing that they are great, both by reason of the excellence of the subject itself, but also by reason of the newness of the thing, and the instrument by means of which they have revealed themselves to our senses. It is a very beautiful and delightful sight to behold the body of the Moon, which is distant from us by almost sixty earthly radii, as if it were no farther away than two such measures. From this, anyone may learn with all the certainty of sense evidence that the Moon is not robed in a smooth and polished surface but is in fact rough and uneven, covered everywhere, just like the earth's surface, with huge prominences, deep valleys, and chasms. Moreover, you will see a multitude of fixed stars never before seen, and have a chance to see them more than ten times as numerous as the stars of the first six magnitudes which have been seen before. But that which will excite the greatest astonishment by far, and which indeed moved me to call the attention of all astronomers and philosophers, is this, namely, that I have discovered four planets, never seen from the creation of the world up to our own time. They have their orbits about a certain star of the heavens conspicuous among those already known, which they sometimes precede and sometimes follow, without ever departing from it beyond certain limits. All which facts were discovered and observed by me not many days ago with the aid of a spyglass which I devised, after first being illuminated by divine grace. Perhaps other things, still more remarkable, will in time be discovered by me or by other observers, with the aid of a similar instrument.</div>

            <h2>2. from On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and co-adaptation which most justly excites our admiration.

We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and in a humble-bee which proves how beautifully they are adapted to each other. We see it in the hook on the leg of a beetle, which is designed to cling to the fur of a mammal. All nature is full of these connections. But it is not enough to just admire them. We must try to understand how they came to be.

No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in the origin of species, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance on the mutual relations of the inhabitants of the world at the present time, and still more so during past ages. Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.</div>

            <h2>3. from The Mountains of California by John Muir</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The great Sierra glacier, in the fullness of its development, crushed and ground its mountain pavements, and worked and planned for the landscapes that were to be. It was a mighty sculptor, chiseling and grinding all the prominent features of the topography, and producing the general outlines of the present scenery. But in the canon of Yosemite, the glacier was not merely a sculptor; it was a creator. The canon was not so much carved as it was born, and the glacier was its parent.

The great creative glacier of the Yosemite was a flowing river of ice, from half a mile to a mile in width, and more than two thousand feet in depth. It poured its massive, grinding current through the valley, not only rubbing down the asperities of the rocks, but quarrying and carrying away immense quantities of the solid granite. The quarrying was effected by the alternate freezing and thawing of water in the joints of the rocks, and by the tremendous pressure of the superincumbent ice.

But the work of the great glacier did not end with the quarrying of the rock. The immense blocks of granite, some of them hundreds of tons in weight, were carried by the glacier as it moved, and were used by it as tools to grind and polish the bottom and sides of the canon. The work was slow, but it was sure. Century after century, the great ice-plow moved on, grinding, polishing, and deepening the canon, until it was brought to its present form.

And what a form it is! A valley of granite, a thousand feet deep, with perpendicular walls, and a level floor. A valley of waterfalls, where the Merced River and its tributaries leap from the cliffs in white sheets of spray. A valley of groves and meadows, where the pine and the oak stand in solemn majesty, and the wild-flowers bloom in profusion. This is the Yosemite, the grandest and most beautiful of all the mountain-canons of the Sierra. And this is the work of the great glacier, the mighty sculptor, the patient creator, who worked for ages to produce this masterpiece of landscape-art.</div>

            <h2>4. from Micrographia by Robert Hooke</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">I took a good clear piece of Cork, and with a Pen-knife sharpen'd as keen as a Razor, I cut a piece of it off, and thereby left the surface of it exceeding smooth. Then examining it very diligently with a Microscope, me thought I could perceive it to appear a little porous; but I could not so plainly distinguish them, as to be sure that they were pores. I had a mind to try if I could not bring it to be view'd in a larger and more lightsome body, and with a greater magnifier. For this purpose, I took a good flat piece of it, and cutting it on a whetstone, I at last, with a very sharp Pen-knife, cut off from the former smooth surface an exceeding thin plate of it.

This thin plate I pasted on a black object Plate, because it was it self a white body; and casting the light on it with a deep plano-convex Glass, I could exceeding plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores were not regular. These pores, or cells, were not very deep, but consisted of a great many little Boxes, separated out of one continued long pore, by certain Diaphragms. Nor is this a very extravagant conjecture, for from the magnified object, it was observable, that the Interstitia, or partitions of these pores were very thin.

Next, in that these pores were not continuous, but divided into many little cells, I could plainly perceive, not only with my Microscope, but even with my naked eye. The whole piece of Cork appear'd like a Honey-comb of brown colour. I told several lines of these pores, and found that there were usually about sixty of these small cells placed end-ways in the eighteenth part of an Inch in length, so that in one square Inch, there must be at least a million of these cells. Our Microscopes inform us that the substance of Cork is altogether fill'd with Air, and that that Air is perfectly enclosed in little Boxes or Cells distinct from one another. It seems that it is this particular structure that makes it so light a body; for the weight of it is not so much as the weight of an equal bulk of Water.</div>

            <h2>5. from The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">A bird is an instrument working in accordance with mathematical law, which instrument it is within the capacity of man to reproduce with all its movements, but not with a corresponding amount of strength, though it is deficient only in the power of maintaining equilibrium. We may therefore say that such an instrument constructed by man is lacking in nothing except the life of the bird, and this life must needs be supplied from that of man. The life which resides in the bird's members will, without doubt, better conform to their needs than will that of man which is separated from them.

A man with wings large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the resistance of the air, and by conquering it, succeed in subjugating it and rising above it. If the bird's wing is nine units in width and one in thickness, the man's wing should be twenty-four units in width and one in thickness. The sinews and the bones of a bird are very strong, because they are hollow. The bones of a man are also hollow, and this hollowness contains the marrow. But the bones of a bird have no marrow; they are full of air. This makes them lighter than the bones of a man and gives them greater strength for their size.

Observe the goose: when it is on the ground it walks clumsily, because its feet are webbed and adapted for swimming. But when it is in the air, its wings are its feet, and it moves with the greatest ease and swiftness. This is because the wings are large and the body is light. The same is true of the bat. Its wings are very large in proportion to its body, and it flies with great swiftness.

I have divided the Treatise on Birds into four books: the first treats of their flight by flapping; the second of the flight without flapping and with the help of the wind; the third of the flight in general, such as that of birds, bats, fishes, and insects; the fourth of the movement of the wings.</div>

            <h2>6. from Elements of Chemistry by Antoine Lavoisier</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">This experiment provides an analysis of atmospheric air, and shows that it consists of two gases, one of which is respirable, and the other is not. The first, the respirable portion, is that which has been combined with the mercury, and which we have since recovered. We shall give it the name of 'oxygen,' from the Greek word 'oxys,' which signifies 'acid,' and 'geinomai,' which signifies 'to engender,' because one of its most general properties is to form acids by combining with many different substances. The other gas, which is not respirable, and which remains in the bell-jar after the calcination of the mercury, we shall call 'azote,' from the Greek particle 'a,' and 'zoe,' which signifies 'life,' because it is deprived of the power of supporting life. We also call it 'nitrogen,' because it is a component part of nitric acid.

The experiment I have just described is one of the most remarkable that has been performed in modern chemistry. It proves that the air we breathe is not a simple substance, as was formerly supposed, but is a compound of at least two very different gases. It also proves that the red substance, which is formed by the calcination of mercury, is a metallic oxide, and that the mercury is revivified by the separation of the oxygen. This experiment is the key to the whole doctrine of combustion, and of the formation of metallic oxides.

Before my time, the chemists, in explaining the phenomena of combustion, had recourse to a supposed substance, which they called 'phlogiston.' They imagined that all combustible bodies were compounds of phlogiston and some other substance, and that combustion was nothing else than the disengagement of the phlogiston. But this theory is inconsistent with the facts. The experiment I have just described proves that, in combustion, something is added to the combustible body, and that this something is oxygen. It is the combination of the combustible body with oxygen which produces the heat and the light, and which constitutes the whole phenomenon of combustion. The phlogiston of the old chemists was a mere creature of the imagination; a gratuitous supposition, which has no foundation in nature.</div>

            <h2>7. from Under the Sea-Wind by Rachel Carson</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">To the eels of the American rivers, the journey down to the sea begins in the autumn, when the land is darkened by the shadows of the first frost. Then the eels, which have lain in the mud of the river bottoms, or in the deep pools of the streams, all summer, begin to stir. They are lean and hungry, and they have a long journey before them. They are driven by a blind instinct, an urge that is as old as the race of eels itself. It is the breeding instinct, which sends them down to the sea, to the deep, dark waters of the Sargasso Sea, where they were born.

The eels travel by night, and hide by day. They are preyed upon by many enemies. The otter and the mink follow them in the streams. The great horned owl watches for them in the shallows. The water snakes lie in wait for them among the rocks. But the eels are wary and cunning. They slip through the fingers of their enemies, and they make their way down to the sea.

In the sea, the eels find new enemies. The sharks and the barracudas, the dolphins and the porpoises, all prey upon them. But the eels are swift and elusive. They swim deep, and they travel fast. They are guided by the currents of the sea, which are as familiar to them as the currents of their native streams. They follow the great ocean river, the Gulf Stream, which flows from the Gulf of Mexico to the coast of Europe.

And so the eels make their way to the Sargasso Sea. It is a strange and mysterious place, a sea within a sea. It is a calm and stagnant sea, where the seaweed grows in great masses, and the water is warm and still. Here the eels spawn, and then they die. Their work is done. They have fulfilled the destiny of their race. And in the spring, the young eels, the elvers, which have hatched from the eggs, begin their long journey back to the rivers of their ancestors. They are tiny and transparent, no bigger than a darning needle. But they are driven by the same blind instinct that sent their parents down to the sea. They are the new generation, which will carry on the life of the race.</div>

            <h2>8. from Birds of America by John James Audubon</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The Passenger Pigeon, or, as it is more commonly called in America, the Wild Pigeon, moves with extreme rapidity, propelling itself by quickly repeated flaps of the wings, which it brings more or in a horizontal direction, and exerting a power of flight which borders on the marvellous. So impetuous and sustained is their flight, that when passing over a country directly opposite to a violent hurricane, I have seen them advance against it, seemingly with as much ease as if it were in their favour.

The multitudes of Wild Pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed, after having witnessed them several times, and yet unable to comprehend their numbers, I have, for the purpose of giving some idea of them to my friends, taken up my pencil, and, extending my arm, have marked the places on the paper where the flock began and ended. In this way I have measured a flock which was an unbroken column for an hour and a half, and which, according to my calculations, must have contained more than one billion pigeons. This may seem an incredible number, but when we consider the vast extent of the country over which they range, the quantity of food they consume, and the numerous enemies they have to encounter, we are led to believe that their numbers must be immense.

The air was literally filled with Pigeons; the light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse; the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow; and the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose.

I have traveled in many parts of the United States, and have seen the Pigeons in all their modes of migration. I have seen them flying in columns of great length, and in masses of immense breadth. I have seen them when, pursued by a hawk, they would form a circle, and when, the hawk having made his choice, the circle would be broken, and the Pigeons would fly off in every direction. I have seen them, when, their feeding-grounds being covered with snow, they would alight on the branches of trees, and, by a simultaneous movement of their wings, would shake down the snow, and thus obtain a supply of food. I have seen them, when, driven from their roosting-places by a sudden storm, they would fly in confusion for a while, and then, as if by a preconcerted signal, would form themselves into a solid column, and proceed on their journey.</div>

            <h2>9. from Experiments in Plant Hybridization by Gregor Mendel</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used, and thus in the case before us it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner the experiment is conducted.

The selection of the plant group which shall serve for experiments of this kind must be made with all possible care. It is necessary that they should possess constant differentiating characters. And they must be such that the hybrids of them, during the flowering period, are regularly protected from the influence of all foreign pollen, or can be easily so protected.

These are conditions which are fulfilled in a very high degree by the Leguminosae, and especially by the genus Pisum (the pea). For the experiments I am about to describe, I have used the pea. The pea has a papilionaceous flower, and the reproductive organs are closely surrounded by the keel, so that the flower is self-fertilizing. This is a great advantage, as it prevents the accidental crossing with other varieties. Another advantage is, that the hybrids of the pea are fertile.

In order to be able to follow the development of the hybrids in the separate generations, it is necessary to keep a careful record of the parent plants, and of the offspring of each cross. This is a tedious business, but it is indispensable. I have, therefore, in all cases, kept such a record.

For the purpose of the experiment, I have selected seven pairs of differentiating characters, and have made a cross with each pair. The seven characters are: 1. The form of the ripe seed. 2. The colour of the seed-albumen. 3. The colour of the seed-coat. 4. The form of the ripe pods. 5. The colour of the unripe pods. 6. The position of the flowers. 7. The length of the stem.

The results of the crosses will be given in detail in the following sections. I shall confine myself here to a few general remarks. It is to be observed, that the hybrids of the pea, in all cases, have the character of one of the parent plants so entirely that the other escapes observation altogether. This is the phenomenon of dominance.</div>

            <h2>10. from Gray's Anatomy by Henry Gray</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The heart is a hollow muscular organ, of a conical form, placed between the lungs, and enclosed in the cavity of the pericardium. It is placed obliquely in the chest: the broad attached end, or base, is directed upwards and backwards to the right; the apex is directed forwards and to the left, and corresponds to the space between the fifth and sixth ribs. The heart is, in the adult, about five inches in length, three inches and a half in breadth, and two inches and a half in thickness. The weight of the heart in the male is about ten ounces; in the female, about eight ounces.

The heart is subdivided by a longitudinal muscular septum into two lateral cavities, a right and a left; and a transverse constriction divides each of these cavities into two, an upper and a lower. The heart, therefore, consists of four chambers, viz., two auricles and two ventricles. The right auricle and right ventricle form the right, or venous side of the heart; the left auricle and left ventricle form the left, or arterial side.

The right side of the heart is the pulmonary heart. It receives the dark-coloured, venous blood from all parts of the body, by the superior and inferior vena cava, and propels it through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, to be arterialized. The left side of the heart is the systemic heart. It receives the red, arterialized blood from the lungs, by the pulmonary veins, and propels it through the aorta to all parts of the body, to nourish them.

This circulation of the blood is carried on by the alternate contraction and relaxation of the muscular walls of the heart. The contraction is called the systole; the relaxation, the diastole. The two auricles contract at the same time, and the two ventricles at the same time. The valves of the heart are so constructed as to allow the blood to pass in one direction only, and to prevent its regurgitation. The sounds of the heart, as heard by the stethoscope, are two in number. They are called the first and second sounds. The first sound is a dull, prolonged, and booming sound; the second is a short, sharp, and clicking sound.</div>
