            <h2>1. Fiction: from A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">They walked down a long, white corridor. The walls were smooth and seamless. The children's footsteps made no sound. It was like walking on a cloud. At the end of the corridor was a large, circular room. In the center of the room was a platform, and on the platform was a chair. And in the chair sat a man.

He was a small man, with a thin, gray mustache. He wore a gray suit and a gray tie. His face was gray, and his eyes were gray, and they were the coldest, most frightening eyes Meg had ever seen. "Good afternoon, children," he said, his voice as colorless as his suit. "I am the Prime Coordinator. Welcome to Camazotz."

Meg felt a cold dread creep over her. There was something terribly wrong with this man, with this place. She looked at Charles Wallace and saw that he was pale, his blue eyes wide with a fear she had never seen in him before.

The man smiled, a thin, tight smile that did not reach his eyes. "We are a peaceful planet," he said. "We have conquered all illness, all deformity, all suffering. Here, everyone is the same. Everyone is happy."

"But they're not happy," Charles Wallace whispered, his voice shaking. "They're not really alive."

"Alive?" the Prime Coordinator said, his smile widening. "Of course they are alive. They are the most alive people in the universe. They have given up their individuality, their little quirks and differences, for the sake of the whole. They are one mind, one body. They are IT."

He pointed a long, gray finger at them. "And soon, you will be one with us. You will be happy. You will be free from the burden of choice."

Meg grabbed Charles Wallace's hand. "No," she said, her voice a fierce whisper. "We won't." She could feel a strange, rhythmic pulsing in the air, a pulsing that seemed to want to draw her in, to make her forget who she was. It was the pulsing of IT, and she knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that she had to fight it.</div>

            <h2>2. Fiction: from The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. I do my work, I trade my kills for money, and I keep my mouth shut.

But today is the day of the reaping.

Effie Trinket, our escort from the Capitol, stands on the stage, her face a plastic smile, her hair a frightening shade of pink. She pulls a slip of paper from the glass ball. "Primrose Everdeen!" she chirps.

My little sister.

Prim, who is the only person in the world I’m certain I love. Prim, who is as fragile as the flower she was named for. A wave of nausea washes over me. The crowd murmurs, a sea of gray faces turning to find the small girl who has been chosen. I see her, her small frame, her white shirttail untucked. She is walking to the stage.

I reach her in a few steps. "Prim!" I cry out, and then I say the words that will change everything. "I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!"

There is a stir in the crowd. In District 12, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with corpse, volunteers are all but unheard of. The reaping is our punishment for a long-ago rebellion.

Effie Trinket is momentarily taken aback. "A volunteer?" she says, her voice losing some of its artificial cheer.

"That's right," I say, my voice steady, though my heart is hammering against my ribs. I walk past Prim, and I can feel her small hands clutching at my shirt. I force myself to the stage, to the place where my sister was supposed to stand. I can feel the eyes of the entire district on me, and for the first time in a long time, my mask has slipped. They can see everything.</div>

            <h2>3. Fiction: from Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry by Mildred D. Taylor</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">By the time we reached the crossroads, the dust was settling, and we could see the Jefferson Davis school bus, a glorious vehicle of red and gold, churning up a fresh cloud of dust as it headed toward Strawberry. The bus driver, a fat, grumpy man, liked to entertain himself by spraying us with dust. Every morning, we would step off the road and wait for the bus to pass. And every morning, he would slow down, then speed up, sending a wave of red dust and mud flying in our direction.

My little brother, Little Man, who was only six and a half, was meticulous about his appearance. His clothes had to be perfectly clean, his shoes polished. The daily dose of dirt was a constant source of agony for him.

Today was different. A heavy rain the night before had left the road a mess of slick, red mud. We were walking single file, trying to stay on the high, grassy bank, when we heard the bus. We scrambled up as high as we could, but it wasn't high enough. The bus driver slowed, just as he always did, and then, with a malevolent grin, he veered close to the bank and accelerated. A wall of muddy water shot up, drenching us from head to toe.

Little Man stood frozen, his face a mask of disbelief. His brand-new suit, his first day of school suit, was splattered with mud. He looked down at himself, then back at the disappearing bus. A low, guttural cry of outrage escaped him.

"It ain't fair," he wailed. "It just ain't fair."

I put my arm around him. "I know, Little Man. I know." But I was thinking about more than just the mud. I was thinking about the Jefferson Davis school bus, and the white children who rode it, laughing at us. And I was thinking that maybe, just maybe, there was something we could do about it. The wheels of my mind began to turn.</div>

            <h2>4. Fiction: from The Call of the Wild by Jack London</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining his muscles against the grim frost, and his heart bursting with a mighty joy.

He was a killer, a thing that preyed, living on the things that lived, unaided, alone, by virtue of his own strength and prowess, surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived. Because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself, which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being. It advertised itself in all his movements, was apparent in the play of every muscle, spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself.

He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars.

"I'm going to kill you," he growled, "but I'm going to play with you first."

It was a strange scene. The man, a creature of a another world, was being hunted by this creature of the wild. Buck was a live hurricane of fury, bounding in and out, teasing, growling, his brilliant eyes flashing. He was playing with the man as a cat plays with a mouse. But this was a cat that could kill a man. And Buck was not playing. He was learning. He was remembering.</div>

(The water pump is in the yard. ANNIE has dragged the struggling HELEN to it. She forces HELEN’s hand under the spout. With her other hand, she pumps.)

<b>ANNIE:</b> (Shouting) Water! Water!

(The water gushes out over HELEN’s hand. HELEN stands shivering, her other hand clenched in a fist. ANNIE continues to pump. Then, a change comes over HELEN. Her body goes still. Her fist unclenches. She holds her other hand out.)

<b>HELEN:</b> (A sound emerges from her throat) Wah. Wah.

<b>ANNIE:</b> (Whispering, ecstatic) Yes. Yes, Helen. Yes!

(She takes HELEN’s hand and spells into it, her fingers moving with frantic speed.)

<b>ANNIE:</b> W-A-T-E-R. Water. It has a name.

(HELEN’s head jerks up. Her eyes, unseeing, are wide. A look of dawning comprehension, of miraculous understanding, illuminates her face. She clutches at ANNIE’s hand, then lets it go and plunges her own hand under the pump again, a look of desperate urgency on her face.)

<b>HELEN:</b> Wah. Wah.

<b>ANNIE:</b> (Crying, laughing) Yes! Oh, my dear, yes!

(HELEN drops to the ground, her hand groping for something, anything. She touches the pump and looks questioningly at ANNIE. ANNIE spells into her hand.)

<b>ANNIE:</b> P-U-M-P.

(HELEN touches the trellis.)

<b>ANNIE:</b> T-R-E-L-L-I-S.

(HELEN’s whole body is trembling with the excitement of her discovery. She turns and runs back toward the house, touching objects, holding her hand out to ANNIE, who follows, spelling the name of everything HELEN touches. The world has opened up to her.)

<b>JUROR #8:</b> (Quietly) There were eleven votes for "guilty." It's not so easy for me to raise my hand and send a boy off to die without talking about it first.

<b>JUROR #7:</b> Who says it's easy for me?

<b>JUROR #8:</b> No one. But we're talking about somebody's life here. We can't decide in five minutes. Supposing we're wrong?

<b>JUROR #10:</b> Wrong? What's the matter with you? You saw the same evidence we did. The kid's a punk. I've lived among 'em all my life. You can't believe a word they say. You know that.

<b>JUROR #8:</b> I don't know that. What a terrible thing for a man to believe! Since when is dishonesty a group characteristic? You have no monopoly on the truth—

<b>JUROR #3:</b> (Interrupting) All right. It's not your business to be telling us what to believe. We have a job to do. Let's do it. Maybe you'd like to know why I think he's guilty. The old man who lived downstairs. He heard the boy yell, "I'm going to kill you." A second later, he heard a body hit the floor. He ran to the door, opened it, and saw the kid running down the stairs. What could be plainer than that?

<b>JUROR #8:</b> I'd like to ask you something. You don't believe the boy's story. How come you believe the old man's? He's one of "them," too, isn't he?

<b>JUROR #3:</b> (Stares at him, then flustered) He's an old man! A terrified old man who knows he's going to die. You're not going to tell me we're supposed to believe that scum's story and not the old man's?

<b>JUROR #8:</b> He was an old man who had to walk with two canes. He said he went from his bedroom to his front door in fifteen seconds. Do you think that's possible?</div>

            <h2>8. Poetry: "O Captain! My Captain!" by Walt Whitman</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
                         But O heart! heart! heart!
                            O the bleeding drops of red,
                               Where on the deck my Captain lies,
                                  Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
                         Here Captain! dear father!
                            This arm beneath your head!
                               It is some dream that on the deck,
                                 You’ve fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
                         Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
                            But I with mournful tread,
                               Walk the deck my Captain lies,
                                  Fallen cold and dead.</div>

            <h2>10. Poetry: "Casey at the Bat" by Ernest Lawrence Thayer</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The outlook wasn’t brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play.
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,
A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.

A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest
Clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;
They thought, if only Casey could but get a whack at that—
We’d put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.

But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,
And the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake;
So upon that stricken multitude a death-like silence sat,
For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.

But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,
And Blake, the much despis-ed, tore the cover off the ball;
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.

Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.

There was ease in Casey’s manner as he stepped into his place;
There was pride in Casey’s bearing and a smile on Casey’s face.
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,
No stranger in the crowd could doubt ’twas Casey at the bat.

Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,
Defiance gleamed in Casey’s eye, a sneer curled Casey’s lip.

And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—
"That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one," the umpire said.</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-1"><p class="question-text">1.

            <div class="question" id="q-10-6"><p class="question-text">6.
