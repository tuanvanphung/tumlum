            <h2>1. The Call of the Wild by Jack London</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">But as the fall of the year came on, the urge to live in the wild grew stronger. He was happier than he had ever been before in all his life. He was living a fuller life, a life of instinct and action, and he was doing it with a body that had never known such fitness. But it was not all. The mysterious call sounded more frequently, and as the days grew shorter and the nights longer and colder, it came to him with greater imperiousness. It was the call of the wild, the song of the ages. From the depths of the forest, a call was sounding, and however vague and distant, he heard and obeyed it. He would stand and listen to it, his head cocked, his ears erect, his whole body tense and straining. It was a call that filled him with a great unrest and strange desires. It caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness, and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what. Sometimes he would plunge into the forest and run for hours, seeking the thing he could not name. But the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire. It was a love that had been born of the contact of man and beast, a love that was deeper than the love of a pet, for it was a love born of gratitude and adoration. Thornton had saved his life, and Buck would have lain down his own for him. So strong was this bond that it held him from obeying the call of the wild to the last. He would go, but he would always return. He would run with the wolves by night, but he would come back to the man by day. He was a creature of two worlds, and the struggle within him was the struggle of two natures. He was at once the wild dog who ranged the forest and the loving pet who sat by the fire. It was a struggle that would not be decided until one of the two bonds was broken.</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-1-1"><p class="question-text">1. The phrase "greater imperiousness" suggests that the call of the wild is becoming more:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-1-options" value="A"> A. gentle and persuasive.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-1-options" value="B"> B. distant and faint.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-1-options" value="C"> C. urgent and commanding.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-1-options" value="D"> D. joyful and celebratory.</label></div></div>

            <div class="question" id="q-1-3"><p class="question-text">3. The author describes Buck's love for John Thornton as "deeper than the love of a pet." What does this distinction emphasize?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-3-options" value="A"> A.

            <div class="question" id="q-1-5"><p class="question-text">5. How does the author create a sense of internal struggle within Buck?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-5-options" value="A"> A.

By contrasting Buck's joyful runs in the forest with his dutiful return to the campfire.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-5-options" value="D"> D. By describing John Thornton as a weak and needy master.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-1-6"><p class="question-text">6. The narrator's tone in this passage can best be described as:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-6-options" value="A"> A. sarcastic and mocking.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-6-options" value="B"> B. detached and scientific.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-6-options" value="C"> C. empathetic and deeply observant.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-6-options" value="D"> D. suspenseful and frightening.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-1-7"><p class="question-text">7. What is the impact of the author's personification in describing the call as something Buck "heard and obeyed"?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-7-options" value="A"> A.

It shows that Buck is confused and imagining things.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-7-options" value="D"> D. It minimizes the importance of the call, making it seem like a simple sound.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-1-8"><p class="question-text">8. The final sentence, "It was a struggle that would not be decided until one of the two bonds was broken," serves to:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-8-options" value="A"> A. resolve the central conflict of the story.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-8-options" value="B"> B. create foreshadowing and build suspense for the future.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-8-options" value="C"> C. reveal that Buck has finally made a decision.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-1-8-options" value="D"> D. suggest that the struggle is unimportant to the rest of the plot.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-1-9"><p class="question-text">9. The word <b>vague</b> is used twice to describe Buck's feelings.

        <!-- Test 2: A Christmas Carol -->
        <div id="test2" class="tab-pane">
            <h2>2. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">“Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,” said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit’s robe, “but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?” “It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,” was the Spirit’s sorrowful reply. “Look here.” From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children; wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment. “Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!” exclaimed the Ghost. They were a boy and a girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacingly. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread. Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude. “Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more. “They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit... “And abide the consequences!”</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-1"><p class="question-text">1. The children, Ignorance and Want, are examples of allegory, which means they:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-1-options" value="A"> A. are real children that belong to the Ghost.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-1-options" value="B"> B. represent abstract ideas or concepts in a physical form.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-1-options" value="C"> C. are magical beings with the power to change the future.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-1-options" value="D"> D. are a figment of Scrooge's imagination caused by his fear.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-2"><p class="question-text">2. What is the author's primary purpose in describing the children so horrifically?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-2-options" value="A"> A. To create a frightening ghost story for the reader's entertainment.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-2-options" value="B"> B. To shock Scrooge and the reader into recognizing the monstrous consequences of societal neglect.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-2-options" value="C"> C. To show that Scrooge has always been secretly afraid of children.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-2-options" value="D"> D. To suggest that the children are evil and deserve their fate.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-3"><p class="question-text">3. The Ghost says the children "are Man's." What is the meaning of this statement?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-3-options" value="A"> A. The children are literally human and not spirits.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-3-options" value="B"> B. The children are the direct responsibility and creation of humankind.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-3-options" value="C"> C. Only men, not women, are responsible for creating these problems.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-3-options" value="D"> D. The Ghost found the children and is trying to find their father.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-4"><p class="question-text">4. The Spirit warns Scrooge to "most of all beware this boy [Ignorance]." Why is Ignorance presented as the greater danger?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-4-options" value="A"> A. Because ignorance is a choice, whereas poverty (Want) is often not.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-4-options" value="B"> B. Because ignorance leads to crime and societal decay, which is the ultimate "Doom."</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-4-options" value="C"> C. Because the boy is physically stronger and more menacing than the girl.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-4-options" value="D"> D. Because Scrooge himself suffers more from want than from ignorance.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-5"><p class="question-text">5. The phrase "a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them" is an example of:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-5-options" value="A"> A. Understatement.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-5-options" value="B"> B. Personification.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-5-options" value="C"> C. Irony.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-5-options" value="D"> D. Paradox.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-6"><p class="question-text">6. The Spirit's final warning, "And abide the consequences!" creates a tone of:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-6-options" value="A"> A. cheerful optimism.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-6-options" value="B"> B. gentle forgiveness.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-6-options" value="C"> C. solemn finality and threat.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-6-options" value="D"> D. confused uncertainty.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-7"><p class="question-text">7. Scrooge's inability to "say they were fine children" marks a significant moment in his character development because it shows:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-7-options" value="A"> A. he is still a cruel and heartless man.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-7-options" value="B"> B. he is becoming physically weak and unable to speak.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-7-options" value="C"> C. he is no longer able to lie to himself and deny unpleasant truths.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-7-options" value="D"> D. he has decided to adopt the children and raise them himself.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-8"><p class="question-text">8. The word <b>prostrate</b> in the phrase "but prostrate, too, in their humility" most nearly means:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-8-options" value="A"> A. standing tall and defiant.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-8-options" value="B"> B. angry and aggressive.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-8-options" value="C"> C. lying stretched out on the ground in submission.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-8-options" value="D"> D. chattering and making a great deal of noise.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-2-9"><p class="question-text">9. How does this scene serve as a critique of the society of Dickens's time?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-2-9-options" value="A"> A.

            <div class="excerpt">Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work. The very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash. Enough to buy an exchange of work, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration. He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong for he was personating a steamboat. Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: “Hi-YI! You’re up a stump, ain’t you?” No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said: “Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?” Tom wheeled suddenly and said: “Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.” “Say—I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of course you’d druther WORK—wouldn’t you? Course you would!” Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said: “What do you call work?”</div>

            <h2>4. The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily—how calmly I can tell you the whole story. It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye!—yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture—a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees—very gradually—I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen know nothing. But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded—with what caution—with what foresight—with what dissimulation I went to work! I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it—oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it slowly—very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!—would a madman have been so wise as this?</div>

        <!-- Test 5: The Gift of the Magi -->
        <div id="test5" class="tab-pane">
            <h2>5. The Gift of the Magi by O. Henry</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit. "Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it." Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled. "Dell," said he, "let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on." The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi. They were the first to give what was truly a gift. It was a gift of love, unselfish and pure. The story of their sacrifice is the story of the first Christmas gift, and as long as there are people who give from the heart, the story of the magi will be retold.</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-5-1"><p class="question-text">1. The ending of this story is a classic example of situational irony because:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-1-options" value="A"> A. the characters get exactly what they wanted for Christmas.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-1-options" value="B"> B. the narrator intrudes to share his personal opinion of the characters.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-1-options" value="C"> C. the actions taken by each character to buy a gift have made the other's gift useless.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-1-options" value="D"> D. the gifts turn out to be cheap and poorly made.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-5-2"><p class="question-text">2. The narrator’s primary purpose for alluding to the biblical Magi is to:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-2-options" value="A"> A. suggest that Della and Jim are religious figures.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-2-options" value="B"> B. prove that giving expensive gifts is the most important part of Christmas.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-2-options" value="C"> C. create a powerful contrast between ancient wisdom and the couple's foolishness.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-2-options" value="D"> D. elevate the couple's selfless love by comparing their wisdom to that of the original gift-givers.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-5-3"><p class="question-text">3. The narrator calls Della and Jim "foolish children" and then, in the same paragraph, declares them "the wisest." This deliberate contradiction serves to:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-3-options" value="A"> A. show that the narrator is confused and cannot make up his mind.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-3-options" value="B"> B. highlight the difference between material foolishness and spiritual wisdom.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-3-options" value="C"> C. correct a mistake he made earlier in the paragraph.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-3-options" value="D"> D. suggest that only children can truly understand the meaning of Christmas.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-5-4"><p class="question-text">4. The final paragraph explains that the "wisest" gift is one that comes from:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-4-options" value="A"> A. careful financial planning.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-4-options" value="B"> B. a sense of obligation.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-4-options" value="C"> C. selfless sacrifice and love.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-4-options" value="D"> D. a desire to receive an equally valuable gift in return.</label></div></div>

            <div class="question" id="q-5-6"><p class="question-text">6. The word <b>ardent</b> in the phrase "her bright and ardent spirit" most nearly means:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-6-options" value="A"> A. artistic and creative.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-6-options" value="B"> B. calm and peaceful.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-6-options" value="C"> C. intelligent and clever.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-6-options" value="D"> D. passionate and enthusiastic.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-5-7"><p class="question-text">7. Jim's reaction to seeing the watch chain ("tumbled down on the couch and...smiled") suggests that he feels:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-7-options" value="A"> A. anger at Della for wasting her money.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-7-options" value="B"> B. deep disappointment in the gift she chose.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-7-options" value="C"> C. an ironic amusement at their unfortunate, yet love-filled, situation.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-5-7-options" value="D"> D. exhaustion from a long day of work and Christmas shopping.</label></div></div>

            <div class="excerpt">Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind. The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master’s gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast—dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. An inquiry was now set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses’ hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, on the farther side of which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin. The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm-tunes, full of dog’s-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As Ichabod was a bachelor, and in nobody’s debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him. It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive...</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-6-1"><p class="question-text">1. The discovery of the "shattered pumpkin" next to Ichabod's hat strongly suggests that:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-6-1-options" value="A"> A. Ichabod had been carrying his dinner home and dropped it in his haste.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-6-1-options" value="B"> B. the "horrible missile" thrown by the goblin was not a human head.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-6-1-options" value="C"> C. a food fight had taken place on the bridge the previous night.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-6-1-options" value="D"> D. the goblin was a farmer who had lost his crop.</label></div></div>

            <div class="question" id="q-6-4"><p class="question-text">4.

            <div class="question" id="q-6-7"><p class="question-text">7.

            <h2>7. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. “Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?” “That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat. “I don’t much care where—” said Alice. “Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat. “—so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation. “Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.” Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort of people live about here?” “In THAT direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.” “But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked. “Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.” “How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice. “You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.” Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how do you know that you’re mad?” “To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?” “I suppose so,” said Alice. “Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”</div>

            <h2>8. O Captain! My Captain! by Walt Whitman</h2>
            <div class="excerpt" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
    But O heart! heart! heart!
    O the bleeding drops of red,
    Where on the deck my Captain lies,
    Fallen cold and dead.

O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
    Here Captain! dear father!
    This arm beneath your head!
    It is some dream that on the deck,
    You’ve fallen cold and dead.

My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
    Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
    But I with mournful tread,
    Walk the deck my Captain lies,
    Fallen cold and dead.</div>

            <h2>9. The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</h2>
            <div class="excerpt" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</div>

In the second and third stanzas, how does the speaker describe the two roads?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-2-options" value="A"> A. One is clearly more difficult and dangerous than the other.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-2-options" value="B"> B. They are physically very similar, with neither one showing significantly more use.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-2-options" value="C"> C. One is a wide, paved highway, while the other is a narrow dirt path.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-2-options" value="D"> D. One leads to a beautiful meadow, while the other leads to a dark swamp.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-9-3"><p class="question-text">3. What is the significance of the speaker's admission that the roads "had worn them really about the same"?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-3-options" value="A"> A. It proves that the speaker made a poor choice and now regrets it.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-3-options" value="B"> B. It suggests the "less traveled" road is a future justification, not a present fact.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-3-options" value="C"> C. It shows the speaker did not look carefully enough before making a decision.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-3-options" value="D"> D. It implies that many other people have faced this exact same choice.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-9-4"><p class="question-text">4. The "sigh" mentioned in the final stanza is ambiguous.

            <div class="question" id="q-9-5"><p class="question-text">5. The title, "The Road NOT Taken," is significant because it emphasizes:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-5-options" value="A"> A. the speaker's satisfaction with the path he chose.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-5-options" value="B"> B. the human tendency to wonder about the opportunities we have missed.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-5-options" value="C"> C. the speaker's plan to return and travel the first road later.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-5-options" value="D"> D. the physical difficulty of the road the speaker ended up traveling.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-9-6"><p class="question-text">6. The final two lines, "I took the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference," suggest a theme about the importance of:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-6-options" value="A"> A. following the crowd.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-6-options" value="B"> B. choosing the easiest path.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-6-options" value="C"> C. conforming to expectations.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-9-6-options" value="D"> D. individualism and nonconformity.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-9-7"><p class="question-text">7.

        <!-- Test 10: Hansel and Gretel -->
        <div id="test10" class="tab-pane">
            <h2>10. Hansel and Gretel by the Brothers Grimm</h2>
            <div class="excerpt">When they reached the middle of the forest, the father said, “Now, children, gather some wood, and I will make a fire so that you don’t get cold.” Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood until they had a small mountain of it. The brushwood was lit, and when the flames were burning high, the woman said, “Now lie down by the fire, children, and rest. We are going into the forest to chop wood. When we are finished, we will come back and get you.” Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, they each ate their small piece of bread. Because they could hear the blows of an axe, they thought their father was nearby. But it was not the axe; it was a branch that he had tied to a withered tree, and that the wind was banging back and forth. After they had sat for a long time, their eyes closed from weariness, and they fell fast asleep. When they finally awoke, it was dark night. Gretel began to cry and said, “How are we ever going to get out of the forest?” But Hansel comforted her. “Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will find the way.” And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand. They followed the pebbles he had dropped, which glittered like newly-minted silver coins and showed them the way. They walked the entire night and, as day was breaking, arrived back at their father’s house. But their second journey was to be far worse. When they were once again led into the forest, Hansel had no pebbles... This time he dropped breadcrumbs. But when the moon rose and they sought their way, the crumbs were gone. The many thousands of birds that fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. They were truly lost. They walked for three days until they came to a small house, built entirely of bread, with a roof made of cake, and windows of clear sugar.</div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-1"><p class="question-text">1. The "blows of an axe" that the children hear is, in reality, a branch banging against a tree. The purpose of this detail is to:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-1-options" value="A"> A. show that the father is a very clumsy woodcutter.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-1-options" value="B"> B. create false hope and emphasize the parents' deliberate deception.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-1-options" value="C"> C. suggest that a monster is lurking nearby in the woods.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-1-options" value="D"> D. prove that the children have an overactive imagination.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-2"><p class="question-text">2. How does Hansel's character change between the first and second journeys into the forest?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-2-options" value="A"> A. He changes from a fearful boy into a brave leader.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-2-options" value="B"> B.

He changes from a loving brother into a selfish individual.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-2-options" value="D"> D. He changes from a naive child into a cynical and distrusting boy.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-3"><p class="question-text">3. The description of the pebbles that "glittered like newly-minted silver coins" is a simile that serves to:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-3-options" value="A"> A. suggest the pebbles are magical and have special powers.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-3-options" value="B"> B. emphasize their value and effectiveness as a guide through the darkness.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-3-options" value="C"> C. show that the family is secretly wealthy and could have afforded food.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-3-options" value="D"> D. imply that Hansel is greedy and thinks only of money.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-4"><p class="question-text">4. The primary element that leads to the failure of Hansel's plan on the second journey is:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-4-options" value="A"> A. his own forgetfulness.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-4-options" value="B"> B. his sister's carelessness.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-4-options" value="C"> C. the darkness of the forest.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-4-options" value="D"> D. the unforgiving forces of nature.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-5"><p class="question-text">5. The house made of bread, cake, and sugar is a powerful symbol that represents:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-5-options" value="A"> A. the wealth and kindness of the people who live in the forest.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-5-options" value="B"> B. a deceptive temptation that masks a hidden danger.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-5-options" value="C"> C. a natural and healthy food source for the lost children.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-5-options" value="D"> D. the reward the children receive for their perseverance.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-6"><p class="question-text">6. The author creates a mood of growing hopelessness primarily by:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-6-options" value="A"> A. describing the father's sadness in detail.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-6-options" value="B"> B. showing the children's journey getting progressively longer and more desperate.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-6-options" value="C"> C. focusing on the beauty and tranquility of the forest animals.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-6-options" value="D"> D. revealing that the stepmother is a wicked witch from the beginning.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-7"><p class="question-text">7. The word <b>withered</b> in the phrase "a withered tree" most nearly means:</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-7-options" value="A"> A. tall and strong.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-7-options" value="B"> B. covered in green leaves.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-7-options" value="C"> C. dry and decayed.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-7-options" value="D"> D. struck by lightning.</label></div></div>
            <div class="question" id="q-10-8"><p class="question-text">8. What central theme about survival is illustrated in this passage?</p><div class="options"><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-8-options" value="A"> A. Human cleverness is always superior to the challenges of nature.</label><label><input type="radio" name="q-10-8-options" value="B"> B.

            <div class="question" id="q-10-9"><p class="question-text">9.
